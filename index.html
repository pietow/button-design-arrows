                A skeuomorph (also spelled skiamorph, /ˈskjuːəˌmɔːrf,
                ˈskjuːoʊ-/) is a derivative object that retains ornamental
                design cues (attributes) from structures that were necessary in
                the original.Examples include pottery embellished with imitation
                rivets reminiscent of similar pots made of metal and a software
                calendar that imitates the appearance of binding on a paper desk
                calendar.

                Flat design is a minimalist design language or design style
                commonly used in graphical user interfaces (GUI) (such as web
                applications and mobile apps), and also in graphical materials
                such as posters, arts, guide documents and publishing products.
